This package uses Fuego as the Go game engine

To install Fuego and get the python wrapper working:

1) Download Fuego from SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuego/

2) unpack archive and move into feature-learning/go/

3) intall: ./configure; make; make install

4) run ./install.sh in feature-learning/go/

Notes: will need gcc, boost, and cython

To get boost on MacOS using homebrew: brew install boost
b/c homebrew uses a newer version of boost than fuego was written for
change all references in the code for native_file_string() to native()
and remove all constructors using boost::filesystem::native
